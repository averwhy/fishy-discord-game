# Fishy.py - Bot for Discord #

## Info ##
This fork of Fishy discord bot is _being_ rewritten in discord.py, and uses sqlite3 as its database.
The original author of this bot is Deda#9999.
Fishy.py is a fishing style game where you compete with other users or even guilds to have the best collection, or highest level, or fish. Originally created by Deda#9999 and written in JavaScript, Fishy was a huge success and is in over 1,000 servers. Sadly, it went offline as Deda could not host it anymore. But I (averwhy) have recreated it, now better than ever.
